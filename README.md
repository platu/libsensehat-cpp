# Yet another Raspberry pi + SenseHat library in C++ programming language

This repository aims to resume the Python API in C++ programming language.

The functions provided by this library are intended for students who are taking their first steps in programming.

Therefore, we use a very small subset of C++ programming language.
. No classes
. Typed input/output through <iostream> (avoids burdens of C stdio formatting)
. IMU RTIMULib library written in C++
