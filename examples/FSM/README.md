# Finite State Machine introduction to simulate and run a robot

This folder contains a set of example programs which provide a step by step
introduction to Finiet State Machine (FSM) C++ coding.

## Non blocking keyboard event detection

As we want to simulate FSM, we need a way to code an event driven program. The
very starting point is to detect key pressed on a keyboard.

Here a first example code : [00_non-blocking-kb.cpp](00_non-blocking-kb.cpp)
